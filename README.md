### Product Description
Our Solana wallet buy-sell bot is a powerful tool designed to automate and obtain all the SOL that is in wallets that have not claimed account closures, providing bot owners with the ability to generate recurring income quickly and effortlessly, with a simple process and creator support.

### What You Will Offer to Your Clients
As the owner of the Telegram BOT, you will present yourself to clients as a specialized service in buying and selling Solana wallets, where users can evaluate and sell their wallets based on transaction history and wallet age. The BOT automates the appraisal and offer process, providing a smooth and secure experience. Clients believe that you buy wallets with good history to sell them to developers, most of whom create Memecoins on Pump.Fun.

### What the Bot Really Does
Behind the friendly interface, the bot performs a detailed analysis of the wallets submitted by users. It verifies how many associated memecoin or token accounts are open and not closed (which can yield approximately 0.002 SOL per account). These unclaimed tokens can be burned using tools like **sol-incinerator**, allowing you to recover the SOL contained in these accounts.

The trick of the method is that many users are unaware of this feature and accumulate a lot of SOL in their wallets without claiming it, and that's where we come in!

The bot provides an automatic offer based on a configurable percentage of SOL recovery. As the BOT owner, you decide whether to keep 100% of the recovered SOL or fulfill the promised payment percentage to the user who sold the wallet (Remember, you are ultimately providing a service—you may choose to fulfill it or not. The BOT is designed for this purpose, but the decision is yours). This flexibility allows you to adapt your business strategy to your needs...

### Referral System
The bot includes a referral system that incentivizes users to promote the platform. Referrals can earn a percentage of the value of the wallets they bring, but as the BOT owner, you have control to decide whether to grant this percentage or retain it as you see fit...

### Key Features
1. **Quick and Easy Connection**: Owners can configure the bot by entering their bot's hash ID in Telegram, their Telegram ID, and the corresponding license when acquiring the BOT.
2. **Automatic Wallet Appraisal**: Users send their wallets and receive an automatic offer calculated based on the number of open token or memecoin accounts, allowing the bot to detect exactly how much SOL is pending claim from that wallet.
3. **Referral System**: Expand bot usage and generate additional income with a system that rewards promoters. This will get more wallets directly to your admin TG, and you decide whether to fulfill and give the indicated amount to the referrals or not.
4. **Total Control Over Income**: You decide the percentage of profit you retain from each transaction and how the benefits are distributed. This means you can specify the percentage to give to the person selling you a wallet and to the referrals.
5. **Transaction Management**: Interface to manage and monitor transactions effectively from the admin TG.

### Instructions for Using the Bot
#### 1. **Initial Setup**:
   - **Step 1**: Create a bot in Telegram using [@BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) and obtain the bot access token. (Free)
   - **Step 2**: Log in to your Telegram account and find your Telegram ID using bots like [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot). (Free)
   - **Step 3**: Enter the license we sent you when you acquired the bot.
   - **Step 4**: Enter the access token (hash ID) and your Telegram ID in the bot's configuration.

#### 2. **Using the Bot**:
   - **Share the Bot**: Share your bot's username with others so they can start interacting. The username you created in @BotFather.
   - **Submit Wallets**: Users access the bot and can submit their wallet addresses to receive offers.
   - **Offer Receipt**: The bot automatically evaluates the submitted wallet and generates an offer based on the percentage you specified and the SOL pending claim.
   - **Accept the Offer**: If the user accepts the offer, they are asked for a secondary wallet where they want to receive the agreed SOL. They are then asked to provide the secret phrase of the wallet they are selling.
   - **Profit Distribution**: Once the secret phrase is submitted, you receive all the details in your admin TG. You then just need to open that wallet, claim the SOL that was pending, and transfer it to your wallet. You then decide whether to give the agreed percentage to the seller or keep it all—this is up to your moral judgment.

#### 3. **Referral System**:
   - **Generate Referral Links**: Each user of the bot can obtain a unique link to refer others, whether they have sold a wallet or not. This helps you get people working for you.
   - **Referral Rewards**: If a referral completes a wallet sale, the user who made the referral can receive up to a percentage of the transaction value. You decide this value.
   - **Referral Payment Configuration**: The bot owner has the option to enable or disable the payment of rewards to referrals and define the percentage of these rewards.

### Technical Specifications
- **Platform**: Telegram.
- **Compatibility**: Mobile and desktop devices.
- **Connection**: Integration via hash ID and license.

### Reference Links and Demonstrations

### Final Note
This bot is designed to trick and find users who have wallets with unclaimed SOL, from accounts that remain open with memecoins, tokens, NFTs...

Even if they have no balance in those tokens or no SOL, there is still unclaimed SOL due to all the accounts that remain open. This is because of how the Solana network works. Therefore, with this BOT and the instructions I will provide, you will be able to obtain a lot of SOL for free! You only need our BOT!
